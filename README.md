# CryptoClustering
---
### Overview
----
The project objective was to cluster a group of cryptocurrencies (based on performance) using the K-Means unsupervised learning technique.  

There were several individual deliverables that needed to be completed in order to complete the overall objective:
<ol><li> Prepare the data </li>
    <li> Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame </li>
    <li> Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data </li>
    <li> Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis </li>
    <li> Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data </li>
    <li> Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data </li>
